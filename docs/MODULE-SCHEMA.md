# The `x-homebox` block

Every module is `modules/<id>/docker-compose.yml`. Compose ignores top-level
keys starting with `x-`, so the metadata below lives in the same file as the
services it describes.

```yaml

Categories: `core`, `media`, `photos`, `files`, `security`, `network`,
`productivity`, `system`, `other`. Anything else falls back to `other`.

## Rules that matter

**`id` must equal the directory name.** `homebox validate` fails otherwise.
Two sources of truth for a module's identity is how a catalog drifts from
what is on disk.

**Nothing declares which containers a module owns.** That comes from Docker's
compose project label (`homebox-<id>`), so the mapping cannot go stale. Name
containers after the app itself — `portainer`, not `homebox-portainer`.

**`port_map` is the host port; `container_port` is the inside port.** They
differ more often than you would think (File Browser publishes 8086 but
listens on 80). The UI links to the first; the second is what a reverse-proxy
entry has to target.

**`color` belongs to the app, not the module.** The Overview tints each
keycap with it, so two apps in one module (Proxy Manager and Portainer in
`core`) come out as different keys. Without it they fall back to the module's
theme colour and look identical.

**`internal: true` keeps a service out of "Your apps".** Databases, caches
and proxies have no UI worth opening, and a list full of tiles nobody
clicks is how a dashboard stops being read.

**Config belongs inside the module.** `${HB_ROOT}/modules/<id>/config/<app>`,
not a shared appdata tree. The point of the layout is that a module is one
folder you can copy, back up or delete.

**Shared user data belongs in the pool.** `${HB_DATA_DIR}` — media, photos,
books, downloads. Anything several modules read (a film Radarr fetched and
Jellyfin plays) goes here, mounted at the same path in every container so
hardlinks work.

**Secrets are names, never values.** Declare the name in `env_vars`, let
`install.sh` generate it into `.env`, and reference it as `${NAME}` in the
service. `homebox secrets <module>` prints them on request.

## `setup.sh`

Optional, at `modules/<id>/setup.sh`. It runs before the first start (and on
every `install`), so it must be idempotent. Use it only for what an image
cannot do for itself:

- seeding a config file the app requires but will not create (`files`)
- creating the pool directories with the right ownership (`media`)

It gets `HB_ROOT` in the environment and should be safe to re-run.

## Storage on another machine

`HB_MEDIA_*` and `HB_DATA_DIR` are paths **on the Docker host**. A bind mount
cannot point at a network address — there is no `//nas/media` form — so a
library that lives on a NAS has to be mounted on this box first:

```
NAS  --NFS-->  /mnt/media_disk on the host  --bind-->  /data/media/movies
```

`scripts/mount-remote.sh` writes a systemd `.mount` + `.automount` pair for
that, rather than an fstab line, because of one failure mode: an *arr app
started against an **empty** mountpoint concludes its library vanished and
begins "fixing" the difference. An automount establishes the share on first
access, so a broken NAS is an error instead of an empty directory.

Two things decide whether this works well:

- **The export must allow this box.** An NFS server that does not list this
  host in the export ACL makes the mount hang and then fail with something
  unhelpful, so the script checks `showmount -e` first and refuses early.
- **NFS, not SMB, for a media library.** CIFS has no usable hardlink support,
  so every import from the download folder becomes a full copy. Keep
  downloads and library inside the *same* export and hardlinks survive.

## Timezones

Set `TZ=${TZ:-UTC}` on every service. Most images ship a zone database and
that is enough.

A **minimal alpine image usually does not**, and the failure is quiet: with
`TZ` set to a name, musl looks it up in `/usr/share/zoneinfo`, does not find
it, and falls back to UTC — *ignoring* a mounted `/etc/localtime`. Every
timestamp that container prints is then hours off. Lend it the host's copy:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - /usr/share/zoneinfo:/usr/share/zoneinfo:ro
```

Never bind-mount `/etc/timezone`: it does not exist on a systemd host, and
Docker creates a *directory* there rather than failing.

## Backups

Every backup of a module — the per-module archive taken before an update, and
the scheduled config backup of the whole box — skips what the module declares
its app rebuilds by itself:

```yaml
x-homebox:
  backup:
    exclude:
      - jellyfin/data/metadata   # artwork fetched again on a library scan
      - jellyfin/cache
      - jellyfin/log
```

Paths are relative to the module's `config/` directory. Declare only what the
app genuinely regenerates without being asked — covers, image caches, logs,
transcoder scratch space. Never a database, a settings file, or anything a
person entered.

The rules are strict, because a module can be authored from the Settings → Catalog form:

- plain path segments only — letters, digits and `. _ @ + -`
- no `..`, no `.` segment, no leading `/`, no glob characters
- anything that fails is dropped, never guessed at

Always give the path to the directory, never a bare name. The dashboard image
runs BusyBox tar, which matches a slash-less `--exclude` against every path
component in the tree: `MediaCover` would drop a directory of that name
anywhere, `radarr/MediaCover` drops exactly one.

For scale, on a real box: Jellyfin's config backed up at 668 MB and 8.9 MB
without `jellyfin/data/metadata`; the media stack at 133 MB and 9.3 MB without
Radarr and Sonarr's covers and logs. A restored backup brings the app's
database and settings back, and the app fetches the rest again on its own.

## Resource limits and logging

Every service should carry them. A home box has no autoscaler: one runaway
container is the difference between "an app is slow" and "the box is gone".

```yaml
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 384M
          cpus: '0.50'
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
```

Without the logging cap a chatty container fills the disk in a month, and a
full disk breaks every other app in ways that look unrelated.

## Every service says what it may do

`homebox validate` fails a module whose service is missing either of these, so
this is not a style preference:

```yaml
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
```

Docker's default is about fourteen capabilities per container, most of which no
app here uses. `no-new-privileges` additionally stops a process inside the
container from gaining any it was not given.

**Adding one back is allowed, with a reason next to it.** Many images start as
root, take ownership of their data directory and drop to their own user; that
needs `CHOWN`, `DAC_OVERRIDE`, `FOWNER`, `SETGID`, `SETUID` and nothing more.
An app that listens below port 1024 inside its container adds
`NET_BIND_SERVICE`. WireGuard and Tailscale add `NET_ADMIN`. Write the reason
as a comment — the next person should not have to rediscover it:

```yaml
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      # pihole-FTL sets file capabilities on itself before dropping to the
      # pihole user, and refuses to run as anything else without SETFCAP.
      - SETFCAP
```

A module that genuinely needs the host says `privileged: true` instead, which
validate accepts in place of `cap_drop` — out loud, rather than pretending.

**Test it before it ships.** `scripts/try-modules.sh <id> …` on a throwaway box
installs each module, waits for its containers, reports whether they are
running or looping and whether their logs are full of refused operations, then
removes it. That run is what produced the capability lists above, and it found
three apps that had never started at all on a clean install.

## Only the supported YAML subset

The `x-homebox` block is read by a small parser (`dashboard/lib/yaml.js`), not
a full YAML implementation: maps, lists, quoted and plain scalars, comments.
No anchors, flow collections or multi-line scalars. Anything outside the
subset throws loudly at `homebox validate` rather than silently losing half a
module. The `services:` section below it is read by Compose itself and has no
such limits.
