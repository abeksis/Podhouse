# Give qBittorrent a web UI account that survives a restart.
#
# Left alone, qBittorrent has NO stored account: it falls back to `admin` with
# a TEMPORARY password that it regenerates on every single start and prints to
# its log. So a fresh qBittorrent install hands you an app you cannot sign in
# to without going to read a container log — and the moment the container
# restarts, whatever you found there stops working. Anyone who had not
# discovered that gets a flat "Unauthorized" and no idea why.
#
# Every other app in Podhouse is seeded with a generated password at install.
# This makes qBittorrent behave the same way: the password lives in .env, the
# dashboard's Live activity card reads it from there, and `homebox secrets
# media` prints it.
#
# Written ONLY when there is no account yet, so a password the user set
# themselves in the web UI is never overwritten by a re-run.

  # against python3 it therefore worked in every test I ran over SSH and did
  # nothing whatsoever for anyone installing the normal way: the seeding was
  # skipped, qBittorrent kept generating a temporary password each boot, and
  # the dialog confidently showed a password the app had never heard of.
  #
  # node is present in both: the dashboard image is built on it, and install.sh
  # already requires it on the host to read module metadata.

  # (a \x00 vanishes, so one salt in sixteen comes out short and the hash
  # silently does not match). Measured — the openssl variant produced a
