# the dashboard, which reaches the host through a detached privileged container
# and nsenter. Two reasons it cannot run inside the dashboard container:
#
#   1. `git` is not installed there. Neither is curl or openssl. The host has
#      all three.
#   2. This script REBUILDS THE DASHBOARD. A process cannot recreate the
#      container it lives in; it gets killed halfway and leaves the box between
#      two versions.
#
# It therefore reports through state/platform-progress.json rather than through
# an exit code anybody is waiting on, because by the time it finishes, whoever
# asked for it has been restarted.
#
# EVERY STEP IS IDEMPOTENT AND THE ROLLBACK IS A GIT SHA. That is the whole
# reason releases are tags rather than tarballs: `git checkout <sha>` puts
# every tracked file back atomically, for free, and the untracked half — .env,
# state/, modules/*/config, data/ — is never touched by a checkout at all.

# window a freeze exists to cover.
#
# Read it again here, from git. Ref advertisement on github.com is served by
# the git backend rather than a CDN, so this is the freshest answer available,
# and it happens one step before anything is written to disk.

# flag is not a freeze switch.

# or a manifest that came back empty, fell straight through to the checkout —
# the two cases a pause most needs to survive, because the first thing a bad
# release does is make people's boxes unable to read anything.
# Two ways to read it, and it only stops when BOTH fail.
#
# Fail-closed has a trap: a check that refuses when it cannot read something is
# only as good as its ability to read it. The first version of this used
# `git fetch main:refs/...` without a +, which git declines as a
# non-fast-forward on a shallow clone — so on a box that had updated before,
# every subsequent update refused itself. Correct behaviour, useless outcome.
#
# So: the git path (freshest, no CDN in the way) with the force it needs, and
# if git cannot do it at all, the same file over https. A box that truly cannot
# reach either has no business checking out a new release.
