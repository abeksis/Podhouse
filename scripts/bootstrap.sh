# Podhouse bootstrap — the one-liner.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://get.podhouse.dev/install.sh | sudo bash
#
# get.podhouse.dev serves this file from main (a Cloudflare Worker that also
# counts installs anonymously, infra/get-worker); the long form,
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abeksis/Podhouse/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh, is the same bytes.
#
# This is the piece install.sh cannot be: install.sh configures a tree that is
# already on disk, and something has to put it there first. This downloads the
# repository, unpacks it to /opt/podhouse, and hands over.
#
# GitHub is the single source. An earlier version had every running Podhouse
# serve its own copy over the LAN, which was removed on purpose: a box that had
# drifted would hand out a tree nobody could reproduce, and it meant an
# unauthenticated endpoint on every machine giving away the whole install.
#
# You are piping a script from the internet into a root shell. That is a real
# thing to be careful about, and the answer is not to trust the wording here:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://get.podhouse.dev/install.sh -o hb.sh
#   less hb.sh && sudo bash hb.sh

# The release a NEW box starts on: whatever releases/manifest.json calls
# stable — the same file every installed box reads to decide what it may
# update to. A fresh install and an update offer therefore agree, a tag that
# has been cut but not yet announced is not handed out, and a paused release is
# said out loud instead of installed quietly.
#
# This used to ask `git ls-remote` for the newest tag, right here — sixty lines
# before step 1 installs git. A clean Debian has no git; the failure was
# swallowed by 2>/dev/null and the fallback was `main`, so a friend installing
# on a fresh machine got the development branch without a word. curl is safe
# to rely on at this point: it is what fetched this script.
#
# No pipes into grep -q or head here. Under `set -euo pipefail` a reader that
# exits early can SIGPIPE the writer and fail the whole pipeline, and a failed
# substitution in an assignment ends the script. Bash's own regex match reads
# the text in place.
