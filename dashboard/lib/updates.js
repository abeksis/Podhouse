/**
 * The Updates page: find containers running an image the registry has since
 * rebuilt, and — only when you say so — update them one at a time.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FINDS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
 *
 * Every module in this repo pins an exact tag. That was a deliberate choice
 * and it stays: a box that silently jumps a major version overnight is a box
 * that breaks overnight. So this never changes the tag in a compose file.
 *
 * What it does find is the case a pinned tag does NOT protect you from: the
 * publisher re-pushing the SAME tag with a patched base layer. `pihole:2026.07.2`
 * today and `pihole:2026.07.2` six weeks from now can be different bytes, and
 * the second one is where the CVE fixes went. Only the digest shows it, which
 * is why lib/registry.js asks the registry for the digest instead of trusting
 * `docker compose pull` to notice.
 *
 * Moving to a genuinely newer version is a Podhouse release — `git pull` and
 * `homebox update`, with the compose file, the config migration and the
 * release note all arriving together.
 *
 * HOW AN UPDATE IS APPLIED
 *
 * One service at a time, in this order, stopping at the first thing that goes
 * wrong: back up the module's config, record the image currently running,
 * pull, recreate only that service, then watch it until it is healthy. If it
 * does not come back healthy, the recorded image is re-tagged and the service
 * recreated from it — the box ends up where it started rather than half
 * updated. Nothing is touched until the confirmation comes back from the UI.
