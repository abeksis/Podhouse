/**
 * "Is there a newer Podhouse, and may this box take it?"
 *
 * lib/updates.js answers that question for the CONTAINER IMAGES an app runs on.
 * This file answers it for Podhouse itself — the dashboard, the CLI, the module
 * definitions, everything tracked in git.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
 *
 * A Podhouse given to someone else is a product with an install base. The update
 * path used to be `git pull && sudo bash install.sh` typed over SSH, which is
 * fine for whoever wrote it and unusable for anyone else. Worse, tracking `main`
 * means every push lands on their box, including the twenty minutes between
 * committing something broken and fixing it.
 *
 * So releases are annotated git tags, and a box moves between tags on purpose.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It does not perform the update. `git` is not installed in the dashboard
 * container, and even if it were, the update REBUILDS THE DASHBOARD — a process
 * cannot recreate the container it is running in without being killed halfway.
 * `upgrade()` launches scripts/self-update.sh on the host through a detached
 * sibling container and returns immediately; the outcome arrives through a file
 * in state/, which is the only channel that survives the restart.
