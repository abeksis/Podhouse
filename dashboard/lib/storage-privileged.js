/**
 * Mounting a NAS from the Settings page.
 *
 * A media library on a NAS is the normal case, and until now the only way to
 * attach one was to SSH in and run scripts/mount-remote.sh by hand. That is
 * the same trip through a terminal the rest of this dashboard exists to
 * remove — and it is the WORST one to leave manual, because the script
 * encodes several things nobody would guess (the immutable bit on the
 * mountpoint, the docker.service ordering, hard mounts, the export ACL
 * check). Sending someone to a terminal for that means sending them to
 * `mount` and a hand-written fstab line, which is how you end up with an
 * *arr app "repairing" a library that was simply not mounted yet.
 *
 * HOW A CONTAINER MOUNTS SOMETHING ON ITS HOST
 *
 * It cannot, directly. A mount lives in the host's mount namespace, the
 * systemd units live in the host's filesystem, and `systemctl` has to talk to
 * the host's PID 1. So the work is handed to a throwaway privileged container
 * that enters the host's namespaces with nsenter and runs the very same
 * script an SSH session would — one code path, not two.
 *
 * ON THE PRIVILEGE THIS TAKES
 *
 * `--privileged --pid=host` is as powerful as it sounds. It is worth being
 * plain that it does NOT widen this dashboard's blast radius: the process
 * already holds the Docker socket, and anyone who can reach that can already
 * start exactly this container. The capability was always there; this only
 * puts a deliberate, audited door on it instead of leaving it implicit.
 * Everything here is still behind the session gate, and every argument that
 * reaches the host is validated below rather than trusted.
