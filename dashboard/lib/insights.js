/**
 * What the apps are actually DOING, on the home page.
 *
 * The launcher tells you qBittorrent is running. It does not tell you it is
 * pulling 4 MB/s with two hours left, and finding that out means opening
 * qBittorrent — which is the one thing a dashboard exists to save you.
 *
 * So: a small poller that asks each installed app its own question and folds
 * the answers into one card.
 *
 *   qBittorrent   down/up speed, how many torrents are moving, the nearest ETA
 *   Radarr        what is downloading, what is released and still missing
 *   Sonarr        the same, plus what airs in the next few days
 *
 * THREE RULES, because this file talks to software Podhouse does not control:
 *
 * 1. **Every source fails on its own.** One app being down, slow or
 *    mid-restart must never blank the card or hold up the others, so each
 *    collector is wrapped and returns an `error` string instead of throwing.
 *
 * 2. **Never invent a number.** A source that could not be reached reports
 *    that it could not be reached. Rendering a confident `0 MB/s` for an app
 *    that did not answer is worse than rendering nothing — you would go
 *    looking for a stalled download that is actually fine.
 *
 * 3. **Credentials are read, never stored here.** The *arr apps keep an API
 *    key in their own config.xml and that is where it is read from, so there
 *    is nothing for anyone to set up. qBittorrent has no such file, so its
 *    login comes from .env like every other Podhouse secret.
 *
 * Addressed by container name on homebox_proxy (`http://radarr:7878`), not by
 * the LAN address: the ports a service publishes are for people, and a
 * published port is something the user is free to change or remove.
